## Requirements
- CNC machine components (motors, frame, etc.)
- Microcontroller (Arduino, Raspberry Pi)
- Drawing tool (pen, marker)
- Power supply
- CNC control software (e.g., GRBL, Universal Gcode Sender)
- Processing.exe(https://processing.org/download)
- Inkscape.exe(https://inkscape.org/release/inkscape-0.48/?latest=1)

## Installation
1. Assemble the hardware (motors, frame, etc.).
2. Install the necessary firmware on your microcontroller (Arduino, GRBL).
3. Connect the control software and upload your G-code.
4. Test the machine with simple designs.
5. G-code extension into the Inkscape software installation extension folder.

## Usage
1. Create or download G-code files for the design you want to draw.
2. Upload the G-code into your CNC control software.
3. Place the drawing medium (e.g., paper) on the drawing surface.
4. Start the machine to begin the drawing process.
